Q1) It says, "Segmentation fault (core dumped) and a dump file named core
    is created

Q2) It bombs in inTable() when accessed through main()

Q3)a) Would not compile.
      There was an issue with 'n' being passed by value instead of refrence.
      Changed 'n' in line 7 to '&n'
  
   b) Would not compile.
      Printf formatting issue %f and %d missmatched by type
      Change formatting to match type i.e. %f for double %d for int

   c) Error found on line 49 with incrimentation of variable numLines.
      numLines incrimented before use.
      Changed to incriment after use to resolve issue.

   d) Would not Compile.
      'n' being passed by value when it needs to be by reference.
      Changed 'n' to '&n' to pass by reference and resolve issue.

   e) I would trace the code starting wiht the function where the eror was            initially given and find that the pivot was not randomized
      To assert this i could put a trace in that tells if the pivot 
      has been changed.

Q4) The compiler only catched simple syntax errors not coding logic errors

Q5) The compiler will catch the error if it is syntax based 
    The debugger should catch the error if it is a run time error.
