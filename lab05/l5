1.1)True and false being 0 and 1 is a little backwards and there is no comment on the global variable, not_eof is a little too confusing for 
	a boolean i would change it to somehting else like isEOF.

1.2) int is_smaller(char *exA, char *exB){
	return strcmp(exA, exB) < 0;

	}

1.3) This was next to impossible to read and therefore a bad choice for names

1.4) a) if( c != 'y' && c != 'Y')
		return;
     b) if (length > BUFSIZE)
		length = BUFSIZE;

     c) flag = !flag;

     d) quote = (*line == '"');

     e) bit = val & 1;

1.5) The evaluation order is not set correctly


1.6)left to right:  1 2
    right to left:  2 1
    n is not redefined: 1 1

1.7) a) if (!isatty(stdin) && !isatty(stdout) && !isatty(stderr))
		return 0;
     b) return retval;

     c) for(k=0; k<5; k++){
		scanf("%lf", &dx);
		x += dx;
	}
	k++

1.8) count is a poor name choice it should be replaced with i
	for(int i =0; i<total; i++){
		if(this.getName(i) == nameTable.userName()){
			return true;
		}
	}

1.9) there is no need for the ?:, there should be '()' around c
	#define ISDIGIT(c) ((c) >= '0' && (c) <= '9')

1.10)I would rewrite them all as static constants

1.11) a) Void functions have no return value
      b) this tests for id n > MAX or if n is odd not if its even
      c) Write a message is very vague and not needed
      d) Add to line counter is also not needed as it is apparent
      e) The incriment line counter coment is not necessary as it is apparent
      f) This increment line counter comment is misleading and unneeded as it is apparent and incriments are usually done by 1 not 2
